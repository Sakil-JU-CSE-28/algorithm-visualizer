# Algorithm Visualizer

A web-based tool to visualize common algorithms. This project demonstrates how various algorithms, such as sorting,searching algorithms, graph, work step-by-step. Designed as an educational tool, it helps users understand algorithm logic through animations and visual aids.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Watch algorithms step-by-step with animated transitions.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Visualize algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and others.
- **User Controls**: Start, pause, reset, and adjust the speed of the visualizations.

## Demo

You can view the live demo here: [Algorithm Visualizer](https://sakil-ju-cse-28.github.io/algorithm-visualizer/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-visualizer.git
   cd algorithm-visualizer
2. **Open the project**:

   - Open the index.html file in your browser to view the visualizations locally.
   - Alternatively, you can use a live server extension if you're working with a code editor like Visual Studio Code.
## Usage

    - Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
    - Click Start to begin the visualization.
    - Use the Pause and Reset buttons to control the animation.
    - Adjust the animation speed and other parameters as available.
## Supported Algorithms

    - Bubble Sort
    - Quick Sort
## Technologies

    - HTML/CSS/JavaScript: The core technologies for the front-end structure, styling, and functionality.
    - D3.js / p5.js:  Libraries for more advanced visualizations and animations.
## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add new algorithms, fix bugs, or enhance features:

    - Fork the repository.
    - Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/YourFeature).
    - Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add some feature').
